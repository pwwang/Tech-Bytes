Ionized air and wires may take headphones to the next level. A group of Swiss researchers has created a prototype for an active noise canceling device that uses plasma. Their device works like noise canceling headphones, but instead of a membrane, it moves the air directly. The prototype device absorbs sound waves from 20 to 2,000 Hertz almost perfectly. This breakthrough could revolutionize noise reduction technology.

## New Python tool checks NPM packages for manifest confusion issues



A security researcher has developed a Python-based tool to help users check for manifest mismatches in packages from the NPM JavaScript software registry. The tool can highlight any inconsistencies in the version, dependencies, scripts, and package name between the manifest and the actual package.json file. This tool can be useful for software developers to ensure the integrity of the packages they are using and protect against potential risks such as cache poisoning, installation of unknown dependencies, and execution of unknown scripts.

## New Ferroelectric Material Could Give Robots Muscles



Researchers have developed a new type of ferroelectric polymer that shows promise as a high-performance motion controller or 'actuator' for medical devices, advanced robotics, and precision positioning systems. The material is exceptionally good at converting electrical energy into mechanical strain, making it a potential candidate for soft robotics and artificial muscles. The researchers propose solutions to overcome the challenges of force and driving field in ferroelectric polymers, including the development of a percolative ferroelectric polymer nanocomposite. This new material can be used for applications that require a low driving field, such as medical devices, optical devices, and soft robotics.
