Google has announced the first Machine Unlearning Challenge, a competition that aims to remove the influence of a specific subset of training examples from a trained model. The challenge will be hosted on Kaggle and will evaluate submissions based on both forgetting quality and model utility. Machine unlearning has applications beyond privacy protection, including removing inaccurate or outdated information from trained models and removing harmful or outlier data. The competition hopes to advance the field of machine unlearning and encourage the development of efficient, effective, and ethical unlearning algorithms.

## Using genetics to gain better insights into human behavior



This article discusses how genetics can provide insights into human behavior. The study of genetics and its influence on behavior is complex, but advancements in genetic databases and data science analysis techniques are making it easier to understand. By studying tiny bits of genes called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), researchers can gain insights into complex traits such as sexual behavior, educational attainment, socioeconomic status, and health behaviors. This research aims to bridge the gap between genetics and social science, allowing for more accurate and replicable social science research.
