## Google AI Introduces MediaPipe Diffusion Plugins That Enable Controllable Text-To-Image Generation On-Device


![Featured image](https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-02-at-1.53.29-PM.png)


Google AI has developed MediaPipe diffusion plugins that allow for on-device text-to-image generation under user control. These plugins enable effective generation management and can be integrated into existing diffusion models. The plugins utilize iterative denoising and language understanding through text prompts to enhance the image-generating process. Control information from a condition image is also introduced to convey details that may be challenging to express through text prompts. The plugins provide low-cost solutions for programmable text-to-image creation and are designed for mobile devices.
