## Meet LOMO (LOw-Memory Optimization): A New AI Optimizer that Fuses the Gradient Computation and the Parameter Update in One Step to Reduce Memory Usage


![Featured image](https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-30-at-12.29.13-AM.png)


This article introduces LOMO (LOw-Memory Optimization), a new AI optimizer that combines the gradient computation and the parameter update in one step to reduce memory usage. LOMO optimizes the training process by reevaluating the algorithmic functionality of an optimizer, decreasing the memory use of gradient tensors, and incorporating gradient normalization and loss scaling. The article showcases the empirical findings of using LOMO to successfully train a 65B model with limited GPU resources and validates its performance on the SuperGLUE dataset collection.

## Angular is getting New Template Syntax


![Featured image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jHfZAAEx--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_420,q_auto,w_1000/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hwbqo0uas7ql6n1s1mip.jpg)


Angular is introducing a new template syntax that includes a transition from the current structural directives to a new built-in syntax. This new syntax aims to improve readability and provide a smoother way to adapt for a wider audience in the frontend world. It also introduces new control flow blocks, such as if-else and switch, which offer enhanced template type-checking and improved performance. The migration to the new syntax is expected to be relatively smooth, with an automated migration schematic being developed by the Angular team. Future opportunities for the new syntax include extending it to accommodate more JavaScript loop flavors and introducing features like virtual scrolling and destructuring support.
